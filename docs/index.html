      <p>
        Hello! I am currently a third year student at University of Fiji. 
        I fell in love with coding from my very first language, C#, which was taught in my first year of university by a lecturer passionate about the field. 
        His passion was contagious and ever since, I have been very interested in coding. 
        I enjoy the problem-solving aspect of coding and being able to create something from scratch.
